This is a test file for grep functionality.

It contains multiple lines with various patterns to test:
- async functions
- regular expressions
- file system operations
- error handling

The grep tests will look for:
1. Specific keywords like "async" and "function"
2. Regular expressions like "test.*file"
3. Error messages and patterns

This file should help verify that the grep implementation:
- Finds all matches in a file
- Handles multiple matches correctly
- Returns empty array when no matches found
- Properly handles special characters

Some example patterns to search for:
async function testGrep() {
  console.log("Testing grep functionality");
  throw new Error("Test error message");
}

// Some JSX
export function HelloWorld() {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
}
