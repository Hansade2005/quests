# Anonymous Usage Metrics Collection

Quests collects anonymous usage metrics to help improve the app and provide you with a better experience. This document explains what data is collected, why it is collected, and how you can control your participation.

## Why We Collect Usage Data

**Our team uses anonymous metrics to understand how people use Quests and to prioritize improvements that matter most to our users.** For example, if we see that many users encounter errors with a specific AI model, we can focus our efforts on improving that integration.

**The more users who participate in anonymous data collection, the better we can understand usage patterns, pain points, and errors.** This helps us make data-driven decisions about which features to build, which bugs to prioritize, and how to improve the overall user experience.

All data collection is anonymous - we do not track or store any personally identifiable information, project contents, or messages.

**You can opt out of usage data collection at any time through the app settings.**

## What Data We Collect

We collect anonymous usage statistics including:

- When the app is launched or closed
- Anonymized AI model interactions such as when a message is sent or an error occurs
- When a project is created or renamed
- When a user views certain screens within the app

## Data Privacy and Security

- **All data is anonymous** - we cannot identify individual users or link data back to specific people
- **No personal information is collected** - we do not track names, emails, file contents, message contents, or any identifying information
- **No project data is transmitted** - your code, files, and project contents are never included in metric data
- **Secure transmission** - all metrics are transmitted over encrypted connections

## How to Opt Out

You can disable usage data collection at any time:

1. Open Quests Settings
2. Navigate to the Advanced section
3. Uncheck "Help Quests improve by submitting anonymous usage metrics"
